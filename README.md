## About

I remembered playing with The Powder Toy years ago, and thought it might be fun to write Conway's Game of Life.

## Building Instructions

This is a Visual Studio project with SFML as its graphical dependency. Opening the solution file, and following the [instructions to set up SFML in Visual Studio](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.3/start-vc.php) should be able to get the project to compile and run

## Interactive Controls

Left Mouse button click to draw cells, F key to step forward a single iteration, space to pause and unpause the game
